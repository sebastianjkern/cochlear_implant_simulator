## Cochlear implant simulator

This signal processing script tries to emulate the changes that audio signals go trough by adding 22 band pass filters together, as used in cochlear implants.

Somehow the changes are not really significant from a listening experience. 

The script DOES NOT simulate the other filtering and amplification that the audio signals will go trough in the ear.
